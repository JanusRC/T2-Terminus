About
-----

Espruino is a JavaScript interpreter for microcontrollers. It is designed to fit into devices with as little as 128kB Flash and 8kB RAM.

Please support Espruino by [ordering one of our official boards](http://www.espruino.com/Order).


Documentation
------------

It'd be best to browse the [Espruino Website](http://www.espruino.com) and read the [FAQ](http://www.espruino.com/FAQ) first.

There's also a [Reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference) for JavaScript commands as well as [Tutorials](http://www.espruino.com/Tutorials). However please note that this repository is under heavy development, and the documentation on the Espruino website will match the version [available for download](http://www.espruino.com/Download) but **not** the latest version on GitHub.

Builds for the [Espruino Board](http://www.espruino.com/EspruinoBoard) (built automatically for each Git commit) are [available from here](http://www.espruino.com/binaries/git)

Current State
-------------

You can download binaries from http://www.espruino.com/Download (these aren't the latest, but are more likely to work with your board)

The only officially supported board is the [Espruino Board](http://www.espruino.com/EspruinoBoard). While Espruino can run on other boards, we make no money from them and so cannot afford to test, fix or support the firmware on them.

If you are a board manufacturer interested in getting your board officially supported, please [Contact Us](http://www.espruino.com/Contact+Us).

* [Espruino Board](http://www.espruino.com/EspruinoBoard) - great support.
* Linux - WORKING
* STM32VLDISCOVERY - WORKING - limited memory so some features removed
* STM32F3DISCOVERY - setWatch is broken (issue #183)
* STM32F4DISCOVERY - WORKING
* STM32F401CDISCOVERY - appears WORKING, but very little testing done
* STM32F429IDISCOVERY - WORKING over serial (A9/A10). No USB and no LCD support
* HY STM32 2.4" - WORKING
* HY STM32 2.8" - WORKING - limited memory so some features removed
* HY STM32 3.2" - WORKING
* Olimexino - WORKING - limited memory so some features removed
* Carambola - WORKING - GPIO via filesystem (no SPI or I2C)
* Raspberry Pi - WORKING - GPIO via filesystem (no SPI or I2C)
* Sony SmartWatch - NOT WORKING - USB VCP support for F2 still needed
* MBed platforms - have not worked for a while - full hardware wrapper still required
* ARDUINOMEGA2560 - compiles, but has never worked. Almost certainly due to ints being 16 bits.
* LC-TECH STM32F103RBT6 - WORKING, but with some issues (LED inverted logic, BTN needs pullup to work)
* ST NUCLEO-F401RE - beta status
* ST NUCLEO-F411RE - early alpha status

Building under Linux
------------------
  
Espruino is easy to build under Linux, and it is possible to build under MacOS with some effort. If you don't have Linux it's **much** easier to install it in a Virtual Machine. See the heading **Building under Windows/MacOS with a VM** below for more information.

### Building for STM32 Boards (incl. [Espruino Board](http://www.espruino.com/EspruinoBoard))
  
The (previously suggested) CodeSourcery GCC compiler is no longer available. We'd suggest you use [gcc-arm-none-eabi](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download).

Download the compiler, set up your path so you have access to it, and run:

```YOUR_BOARD_NAME=1 RELEASE=1 make```

* See the top of Makefile for board names
* Without `RELEASE=1`, assertions are kept in the code (which is good for debugging, bad for performance + code size)
* `BOARDNAME=1 RELEASE=1 make serialflash` will flash to /dev/ttyUSB0 using the STM32 serial bootloader (what's needed for the Espruino and HY boards)
* `BOARDNAME=1 RELEASE=1 make flash` will flash using st-flash if it's a discovery board, the maple bootloader if using that board, or will copy the binary to `/media/NUCLEO` if using a Nucleo board.

It may complain that there isn't enough space on the chip. This isn't an issue unless you save to flash, but you can fix the error in a few ways:

* Disable the check by adding `TRAVIS=1`
* Change the compile flags from `-O3` to `-Os` in the `Makefile`
* Knock out some functionality (like `USE_GRAPHICS=1`) that you don't need in the `Makefile`
* Try different compilers. `codesourcery-2013.05-23-arm-none-eabi` provides low binary size for `-O3`

**Note:** Espruino boards contain a special bootloader at `0x08000000` (the default address), with the Espruino binary moved on 10240 bytes to `0x08002800`. To load the Espruino binary onto a board at the correct address, use `ESPRUINO_1V3=1 make serialflash`. If you want to make a binary that contains the bootloader as well as Espruino (like the ones that the Espruino Web IDE expects to use) use the script `scripts/create_espruino_image_1v3.sh` which will compile the bootloader *and* Espruino, and then join them together.

### Building for Linux

Simple: Just run `make`

## Building for Arduino

This does not work right now - these steps are only to get you started!

* `sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude`
* `sudo cp -r /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino targetlibs/arduino_avr`
* `ARDUINOMEGA2560=1 make`
* You'll then need to flash the binary yourself

### Building for Raspberry Pi

On the Pi, just run `make`.

Or to cross-compile:

```
cd targetlibs
mkdir raspberrypi
cd raspberrypi
git clone git://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git
sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
```

### Building for Carambola (OpenWRT)

To cross compile,

* Follow instructions at <https://github.com/8devices/carambola> to set toolchain up in ```~/workspace/carambola```
* Run ```CARAMBOLA=1 make```

### Building Documentation

```python scripts/build_docs.py ```

This will create a file called ```functions.html```


Building under Windows/MacOS with a VM
---------------------------------

* Download and install the correct [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for your platform. eg. If you have Windows, download 'VirtualBox for Windows Hosts'.
* Download the [Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit Desktop ISO Image](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* Run VirtualBox, and click the 'New' button
* Give the new OS a name, choose `Linux` as the type, and `Ubuntu (32 bit)` as the version
* Click `Next`, choose 2048MB of memory, and not to create a hard disk image (ignore the warning). **Note:** We're going to run Ubuntu right from the virtual CD without installing (because it's a bit faster and easier). If you have time you might want to create a hard disk image (you won't need as much memory then) and then choose to install Ubuntu when given the chance.
* Click start, and when prompted for a CD image choose the Ubuntu ISO you downloaded
* Wait until a picture of a keyboard appears at the bottom of the screen, then press enter
* Select a language, and then choose `Try Ubuntu` with the arrow keys
* When it's booted, press Alt-F2, type `gnome-terminal`, then enter. **Note:** You could also just press Ctrl-Alt-F2 to get a faster but less shiny-looking terminal window.
* In the terminal, type: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:terry.guo/gcc-arm-embedded` and press enter when prompted
* Type `sudo apt-get update`
* Type `sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi git` and press 'Y' if prompted
* Type `git clone https://github.com/espruino/Espruino.git`
* Type `cd Espruino`
* Type `ESPRUINO_1V3=1 make` and wait
* Espruino is now built. See the documentation under **Building under Linux** for more examples.
* When you exit the VM, make sure you choose `Save State`. If you `Power Off` you will lose everything you've done so far.

There's some more information on how to do this on the forum at http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/151 including links to a pre-made [Amazon EC2 instance](http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/151/?offset=25#comment20326).


### To flash Espruino from the VM

* Plug the Espruino board in while holding BTN1, and wait for Windows to finish connecting to the USB device
* Go into the VirtualBox Manager (There's no need to stop your VM)
* Click on `USB`, then click on the icon with the `+` sign (With the tooltip 'Adds a new USB filter ... selected USB device')
* Click on the device labelled `STMicroelectronics STM32 ...`
* Now unplug the Espruino board, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in (holding BTN1 again)
* Go back into the VM, and type `sudo ESPRUINO_1V3=1 make serialflash` 
* Your board will now be flashed

**Note:** if you want to you can change permissions so you don't need `sudo` by typing `sudo cp misc/45-espruino.rules /etc/udev/rules.d;sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` and then re-inserting the board.



Testing
------

There are a bunch of tests in the `tests` directory. See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for examples on how to run them.

Modifying
--------

### Directories and Files

* `ChangeLog`:          What's new
* `TODO`:               List of things to do
* `boards/`:            Information on boards, used to auto-generate a lot of the code
* `gen/`:               Auto-Generated Source Files
* `libs/`:              Optional libraries to include in Espruino (Math, Filesystem, Graphics, etc)
* `misc/`:              Other useful things
* `scripts/`:           Scripts for generating files in gen, and for analysing code/compilation/etc
* `src/`:               Main source code
* `targetlibs/`:        Libraries for targeted architectures
* `targets/`:           Specific code for targeted architectures
* `tests/`:             JavaScript Testcases
* `benchmark/`:         JavaScript Benchmarks
* `dist_*`:             files to be copied into distribution zip file

### Adding more devices

Currently there are a bunch of different files to modify. Eventually the plan is to fit everything into boards/BOARDNAME.py and to auto-generate the rest of the config files.

* Most build options handled in `Makefile`
* Extra libraries like USB/LCD/filesystem in `Makefile`
* `boards/*.py` files describe the CPU, available pins, and connections - so the relevant linker script, headers + docs can be created
* `boards/pins/*.csv` are copies of the 'pin definitions' table in the chip's datasheet. They are read in for STM32 chips by the `boards/*.py` files, but they are not required - see `boards/RASPBERRYPI.py` for an example.
* Processor-specific code in `targets/ARCH` - eg. `targets/stm32`, `targets/linux`
* Processor-specific libs in `targetlibs/foo` 
* `src/jshardware.h` is effectively a simple abstraction layer for SPI/I2C/etc

### Adding libraries

* Create `jswrap_mylib.c/h` in `libs/`
* Create library functions (see examples in other jswrap files, also the comments in `scripts/common.py`)

See [libs/README.md](libs/README.md) for a short tutorial on how to add your own libraries.


Using Espruino in your Projects
---------------------------

If you're using Espruino for your own personal projects - go ahead, we hope you have fun - and please let us know what you do with it on http://www.espruino.com/Forum!

However if you're planning on selling the Espruino software on your own board, please talk to us:

* Read the terms of the MPLv2 Licence that Espruino is distributed under, and make sure you comply with it
* MPLv2 dictates that any files that you modify must be made available in source form. New files that you create don't need to be made available (although we'd encourage it!)
* You won't be able to call your board an 'Espruino' board unless it's agreed with us (we own the trademark)
* You must explain clearly in your documentation that your device uses Espruino internally
* If you're profiting from our hard work without contributing anything back, we're not going to very motivated to support you (or your users)
