            Add 'changeInterval' to allow things created with setInterval to have the frequency changed (eg. stepper motor control)
            Now puts itself to sleep to save power, when it knows nothing is required and it'll be woken up by SysTick before
            Change Math library to avoid putting constants in RAM

            analogWrite now working!
